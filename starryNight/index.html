StarryNight

<img src="istarnight.png" alt="StarryNight Interface" width="512" height="327">

An artistic interface for the curated, online archive of Rhizome’s email discussion list

Rhizome was founded by Mark Tribe in 1996 as an email discussion list for artists

Each email in the archive was represented by a glowing point of light against a dark background

Light increases in brightness each time its corresponding message was accessed in the archive

Created “constellations,” connecting emails with related keywords

Each week, selected emails would be saved to an edited archive called TextBase, with keywords added to each message for more effective searching.

Thoughts and Impressions

a place for discussion, exchange of ideas, information, presentation

Memex vibes? Or like search recommendations google gives you

Forming constellations is like creating a chapter or categorization

aesthetically pleasing

fun way to archive emails & see which ones are related as constellations

A very unorthodox interface and platform to achieve this sort of communication and collaboration, but fits well within the theme of it being a “hub”  of sorts for artists to share. Also a unique and aesthetic one at that.
