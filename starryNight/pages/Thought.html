        <h2>Thoughts and Impressions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Place for discussion, exchange of ideas, information, presentation
            </li>
            <li>Memex vibes? Or like search recommendations Google gives you</li>
            <li>
                Forming constellations is like creating a chapter/categorization or "group chat" for artists
            </li>
            <li>
                Aesthetically pleasing fun way to archive emails & see which ones are related as constellations
            </li>
            <li>
                A very unorthodox interface and platform to achieve this sort of communication and collaboration, but fits well within the theme of it being a “hub” of sorts for artists to share. Also a unique and aesthetic one at that.
