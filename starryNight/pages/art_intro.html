            An artistic interface for the curated, online archive of Rhizome’s email discussion list. Rhizome was founded by Mark Tribe in 1996 as an email discussion list for artists. Each email in the archive was represented by a glowing point of light against
            a dark background. Light increases in brightness each time its corresponding message was accessed in the archive. The program created “constellations,” connecting emails with related keywords. Each week, selected emails would be saved to an
            edited archive called TextBase, with keywords added to each message for more effective searching.<br />
