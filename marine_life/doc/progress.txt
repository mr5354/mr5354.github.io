- scroll research
- attempt scroll-snap but couldn't use full page gradient with it
 - had a page with two scrollbars (one for gradient, one for scroll-snap)

- parallax research
- tried parallax using jquery
 - when I used absolute position, it centered everything on the same place
  -> used relative position in parent element, worked
21:00
- parallax works, but lower elements disappear because they use same values
 -> used remainder to solve
- scrollTo research
- try to use scrollIntoView function & counter to pseudo snap scroll
