Episode 1
- cameras enabled reproduction of art
 - no longer need to go to museum/display to see it
- original has a certain silence and stillness
- reproductions have a certain purpose and meaning attached to it, mostly not the meaning that original author intended
 - ads can pair an artwork with their product, changing the meaning of the piece
- people can focus on a part of the piece (zoom in/crop) and disregard the whole, stripping the meaning behind the whole
- the environment in which the piece is adds to the meaning of the piece
 - ex: music while showing the art, camera focus/panning/zooming on art, the building it's in, the surrounding items & atmosphere, etc.

I think this program applies now more than ever, especially with the social media platforms and internet. People can search any piece of art online, copy and paste into their own works, crop it to support their own argument even if it has nothing to do with the intended meaning of the art. No one needs to be in the actual location of where the art piece is displayed; very convenient but also takes away from the experience of seeing the art where it's intended to be. Maybe even the location and way it's displayed is different from the creator's intent because they passed away and the pieces are administered by the owners. We can't tell. I love how they mentioned music and atmosphere placed around the art is part of how we interpret it or how the users try to convey a certain meaning. It's manipulative, using the piece for our own purposes, suggesting a certain meaning that the users want to convey, not the creator. The last part with the children interpreting it freely was warming, but also eye-opening, showing how knowledge could become a lens getting in the way of interpreting a piece freely. Like they said, I immediately wanted to know the context behind the painting before making interpretations, instead of enjoying it by itself. In the end, the meaning behind a piece depends on the person, and the atmosphere around it could be used to manipulate and mold it into a certain way.
