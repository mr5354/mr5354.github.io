Episode 1
- cameras enabled reproduction of art
 - no longer need to go to museum/display to see it
- original has a certain silence and stillness
- reproductions have a certain purpose and meaning attached to it, mostly not the meaning that original author intended
 - ads can pair an artwork with their product, changing the meaning of the piece
- people can focus on a part of the piece (zoom in/crop) and disregard the whole, stripping the meaning behind the whole
- the environment in which the piece is adds to the meaning of the piece
 - ex: music while showing the art, camera focus/panning/zooming on art, the building it's in, the surrounding items & atmosphere, etc.

I think this program applies now more than ever, especially with the social media platforms and internet. People can search any piece of art online, copy and paste into their own works, crop it to support their own argument even if it has nothing to do with the intended meaning of the art. No one needs to be in the actual location of where the art piece is displayed; very convenient but also takes away from the experience of seeing the art where it's intended to be. Maybe even the location and way it's displayed is different from the creator's intent because they passed away and the pieces are administered by the owners. We can't tell. I love how they mentioned music and atmosphere placed around the art is part of how we interpret it or how the users try to convey a certain meaning. It's manipulative, using the piece for our own purposes, suggesting a certain meaning that the users want to convey, not the creator. The last part with the children interpreting it freely was warming, but also eye-opening, showing how knowledge could become a lens getting in the way of interpreting a piece freely. Like they said, I immediately wanted to know the context behind the painting before making interpretations, instead of enjoying it by itself. In the end, the meaning behind a piece depends on the person, and the atmosphere around it could be used to manipulate and mold it into a certain way.

Episode 2
- how women are seen
 - women are constantly seen/judged and reminded of their image
 - have many expectations of actions, appearance, etc.
- to be naked is to bee seen as yourself, to be nude is to be seen naked as an object
- nude painting has an awareness of being seen by the spectator
- women get judged/shamed for showing themselves on display, even if the painter is a man
- women in European painting have exaggerated features and poses to look "available" and appeal to the male spectator of the painting
- different types of narcassism for male & female
 - female has a more passive type, based on the views of others looking at them
 - male has more self-centered type bc the world around them revolves around the male aspect of their identity
- self delight
- women have a more set image of what beauty is within society and feel they have to live up to it more

I've always disliked this type of objectification/judgement made upon myself, making me feel unsafe and not want to be seen as a female individual. I walk around everyday, seeing what people wear, and it strikes me that male-seeming people have a more nonchalant look compared to female-seeming people. Maybe it's just preference, but the female side just looks overwhelmingly more calculated in what they wear. Like Berger shows, the idea of women being an object is engrained in society since the Bible - maybe even earlier. The situation has improved significantly, but there still is a divide in the image of the male/female genders.


Episode 3
- where does the value of paintings come from?
- paintings are unique objects that could be bought and owned
 - shows different environments and subjects
- European oil paintings emphasized tangibility, texture, etc of it
 - emphasis of real being solid became closely connected with a sense of ownership of the painting
- paintings from other cultures had a static order of things, often showing symbolic figures, deities, etc
 - European paintings glorified conquering/wealth and the ability to buy, furnish, and to own
- food, objects, livestock, buildings (landed property), the owner of the painting, etc became the subject of the painting
 - portrait paintings were records of the confidence of those to whom ownership brought confidence
- paintings were only available to the rich population, only recording the lives of the rich
- European paintings celebrated property
 - sometimes implying women are property (yikes)
- although tradition and culture is a good viewpoint, it is also important to see the painting by itself, the meaning of it individually

I have never considered illustrations as a display of private possessions, most likely because the tradition and culture has changed. It is still interesting to see that in the past, it was the case for most of the paintings created. The value of paintings is essentially the combination of materials used, time alloted to create it, and the time spent to develop the skill of creating the painting. It feels as if time, by itself, has become a factor too. Older paintings have more historical value than the more recent ones. This is the case for most objects that have survived for a long period of time. Paintings especially have value because of their uniqueness. The older forms of computer, for example, would have less value most likely because there were many of them. The value of objects are all subjective though. If someone feels attracted to a certain painting, they would pay more, increasing the value of the painting. It is interesting how paintings created as a display of wealth turned into a possession to express wealth as time progressed.


Episode 4
- publicity, ads, propaganda
- "publicity proposes to each of us, in a consumer society, that we change ourselves or our lives by buying something more"
 - the "more" makes us richer in life, but poorer economically
 - ads show people who have apparently been transformed, as a result, enviable
 - the state of being envied is what constitutes glamour, and publicity is the process of manufacturing glamour
- when social class is more or less determined at birth, personal envy is a less familiar concept
 - without social envy, glamour cannot exist
- envy is a sign that democracy and more equality exists in a society
- paintings are devices of atmosphere when used in publicity
- color photos are the new "oil paintings"
 - both demonstrate "you are what you have"
- oil paintings showed the possessions of the owner
- photos in publicity showed the possessions the spectators aspire to have
 - they show it could only be achieved by money and works on our anxieties about money
- publicity often uses fear of not being desirable, not enviable
- "[publicity] suggests that you are inadequate as you are, but it consoles us with a promise of a dream"
- the more monotonous the present, the more desirable and distant the advertised future becomes
- "publicity pretends to interpret the world around us and to explain everything in its own terms"
- publicity needs to glamorize neutral objects
 - abuses reality of public figures and events & struggles in other parts of the world
- oil paintings were surrounded by golden frames, displaying the wealth of the owners
- publicity images are surrounded by us, as we are
 - they exclude us as we now are

So much of this chapter applies to the present. A question that popped in my head: are the enviable traits different from the past? What defines enviable depends on the consumer population, since the consumers are the ones responding and making the profit for the companies making the ads. Since values and views have changed over the years, have the ads changed to target those sets of values? Most likely yes. The principle still stands, that appealing to fear is a good way to persuade people to change their present - by buying their product. Appealing to the desires of fitting in and being enviable seems to still be a trend in publicity. "If you use our product, you'll have a happier life." I never considered ads in this way - showing a possible future, made possible by their product. I love how Berger said "publicity pretends to interpret the world around us and to explain everything in its own terms" to persuade us to buy the product. It shouldn't matter how others interpret our world, but showing a different world that looks appealing makes us distrust our own interpretations. I can see why my father loathes TV ads. I think social media has greatly impacted how publicity works: individuals, not just companies, could be a display of an enviable life. Instagram, for example, is mostly pictures of people enjoying their lives, uploading the best moments, not the difficulties in life.
